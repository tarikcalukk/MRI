# **Medical Imaging Project: MRI and CT Signal Processing**

## **Overview**
This project explores the application of **digital signal processing (DSP)** in medical imaging, specifically focusing on **MRI** and **CT technologies**. The aim is to improve image quality and enhance diagnostic accuracy by applying various DSP techniques.

The project is divided into two main parts:
- **MRI** signal processing, which I handled, and
- **CT** signal processing, completed by a colleague.

Our work utilizes advanced algorithms to reconstruct and optimize medical images, reduce noise, and ensure high-resolution output.

## **Project Structure**
### **MRI Section** (My Contribution)
In the MRI segment of the project, **Python** was the primary language used for developing algorithms aimed at image reconstruction and signal processing. Key tasks include:
- Implementing **Fourier Transform** for accurate image reconstruction,
- Applying **noise reduction filters** to enhance image clarity,
- Improving **resolution** by fine-tuning signal manipulation techniques,
- **Simulating MRI data** and applying DSP methods to real-world datasets.

The Python code is structured to efficiently process large MRI datasets while maintaining high image quality and diagnostic relevance.

### **CT Section** (Colleague's Contribution)
The **CT** part, handled by my colleague, follows a similar approach with a focus on CT image processing:
- Use of signal processing techniques to enhance CT images,
- Image reconstruction using algorithms tailored for CT data.
